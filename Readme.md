# âš™ MQTT COMMANDER - A fast, robust and easy to use MQTT rule engine

## How does ist work an what can i do with it ?

The principle is simple: <br>
a automations consists of two components: constraints and actions. <br>
If all constraints are met, the configured actions are triggered.

### Example:
```yml
  - Name: My Awesome Example Rule
    Constraints: 
      - Mqtt : livingRoom/sensor.temperature >= 25
    Actions:
      - Mqtt : relais/fan.on = 1
      - Mqtt : system/notification = "Too hot ðŸ”¥! Fan has been tunred on ðŸ”Œ!"
```
Of course, you can make the rules more complex and use additional conditions. These are described below.

The rules are saved in ".yml" files. These are saved in the "Automations /" folder. When the software is started for the first time, an example file is created there. Sub-folders are also possible.

**Changes to the files are automatically transferred to the live system. âœ…**<br/>
(Attention: If a ".yml" is changed, all the rules contained therein are restarted)

## Features
* Supports JSON encoded MQTT Messages (e.g. **mytopic/sensor.value**)
* Supports all common comparators [<,>,<=,>=,==,!=]
* Supports RegEx in String compararison
* Supports Cron triggered events
* Supports HTTP calls
* LIVE reload of config files
* Templates
* Special functions, like Timeout, reminder and auto reset of rules
* Web-Dashbaord ro review the Status of your Rules 
* Focus on reliability and speed

## Getting Started:

QuickStart on Docker:
```
docker run -it -p 9090:9090 -v mqttcommanderdata:/data --name mqttcommander calkoe/mqttcommander
```
Note: Your Config files will be stored at the "mqttcommanderdata" volume.

<br/>

Use one of this pre-Compiled Binarys, at the first start an order with the name "Config" is automatically created, here you will also find some sample files.

[Download MqttCommander](https://github.com/calkoe/MqttCommander/releases)

Of course, you can also start or compile the program yourself after downloading this repository.

```bash
    go run MqttCommander
```

```bash
    go build MqttCommander
```

When the software is started for the first time, the configuration folder structure is created in the same directory as the executable file.

Enter the URI of your MQTT server in the "config.yml" file.

After restarting the software, you will find an overview of the active automations at http://localhost:9090 ðŸ”¥

## Create more complex rules:
```yml
- Name: Full Demo MQTT Automation
  Mode: AND
  Retrigger: true
  Pause: 10s
  Delay: 0s
  Reminder: 1m
  Constraints: 
    - Mqtt : demo/sensor.value <= "3" (Reset 2s)  (Timeout 5s) (BlockRetained 0)
  Actions:
    - Mqtt : demo/actuator = 1 (Retained 0)
```

Most of the functions are self-explanatory based on the examples, but detailed documentation will follow soon

## Roadmap:
- [x] Add Support for Multi-Level JSON Objects
- [ ] Complete Documentation
- [ ] Add Support for XOR Rules
- [ ] Redesign File-Overview in Dashboard
- [ ] Add Browser File-Editor
